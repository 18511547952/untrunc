In a video we found:

2 hint tracks.
It looks like a marker for packets
Begin of the hint
00 00 00 0C 0C FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 80

End of the hint looks like it's always 18 bytes!
00 01 01 0C 0C FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 80 00 00

The lenght of the packet in the index included the marker at the end of the packet (audio, video), 
but only before the hint!

Same for the hint packets 


Strange marker for 00 00 00 03 0C FF 80 //3 bytes?

00 00 00 05 0C FF FF FF 80

00 01 01 05 0C FF FF FF 80 00 00 .... 00 (18 bytes.

why some times it's 16 some times less bytes?\ might be alignment but not clear.

Other problem: the hint data starts right after short packet.
while the vid/audio start after 18 bytes the 00 01 01 etc, independently!


Packet hint structure:

2 Bytes : number of entries (N)
2 Bytes: zeroes.

N packet entris:

4 bytes: relative time
2      : RTP header info
2      : RTP sequence number
2      : flags
2      :  entry count: in data table
extra TLV if flagged X bit number 3
TLV: 4 bytes for number of entries
+ eache entry is 4 size, 4 type, data padded to (size  -8 + 3)/4*4;

Data table
each entry is 16 bytes.

In our video we had entry count = 2 so 12 + 16*2 = 44 bytes per number of entrie (N) + 4.
