For each track we can:

1) guess beginning (with decent confidence)
2) guess length

For movie:

1) guess start

We can solve when (1 stream)

guess beginning
or
guess length (and can guess start)

We can solve when (2 streams)

both guess beginning
or
both guess length (only if interleaved!)
or
guess beginning and length in one (only if strictly interleaved!)
or
both guess length and guess movie start


Fail when:

from example: if all packets has some start (and
